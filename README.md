    Dashboard -->|View Stats| User

Explanation:

User reports an issue by creating a service request.

Admin assigns the request to a worker.

Worker starts the task and optionally uploads proof of completion.

Admin verifies the completion.

Dashboard provides stats to Admin and optionally Users.
